AudioKit Examples
=================

We include two example projects with AudioKit, a Hello World example that produces a simple sine wave, and an AudioKit Demo project that has various sections demonstrating sound synthesis, processing, and analysis.  In turn, each one of these examples is created in iOS and OSX and in Objective-C and in Swift.

In addition to these examples there is an entire repository of example projects availabe at [http://github.com/audiokit/examples].

More information and audio clips for the examples are available at <http://audiokit.io/examples>.
